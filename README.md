# ML Project Repository

This repository contains machine learning projects focused on wine quality prediction and risk management.

## Projects

* **Predicting Wine Quality (Predicting-wine-quality.ipynb)**
   * Explores various machine learning techniques to build models that predict the quality of wine based on its characteristics.
   * Utilizes datasets containing different attributes of wines (e.g., acidity, alcohol content, residual sugar).
   * Evaluates model performance using appropriate metrics.

* **Risk Management (Risk-management.ipynb)**
   * Develops models to assess and predict various types of risks (e.g., financial, operational, cybersecurity).
   * May involve techniques like classification, regression, or time-series analysis.
   * Employs suitable risk assessment frameworks and methodologies.

## Datasets 

* **Wine Quality:** 
* **Risk Management:** 

## How to Use

- **Explore the notebooks:** Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or a similar environment to run the code and understand the analysis.
